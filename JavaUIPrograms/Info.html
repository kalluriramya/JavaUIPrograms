        <h2>Ramya Kalluri BioData</h2>
        <p>
                Well, I’m Ramya Kalluri F1 international student.
                I recently graduated from university of Houston clear lake in software engineering with 3.7 GPA 
                which shows my knowledge and passion towards learning. I have some good knowledge on few core and
                web technologies like Java, C, C++, JavaScript, HTML and SQL servers. I’m more passionate about 
                learning new things and technologies as part of it, I started learning about Java and some other databases.
                I’m more interested in taking challenges and achieving them with perfection and I can also add that, 
                my strong communication and management skills made me an effective team manager for all the academic projects 
                that I did so far where I stick to deadlines and keep track of our team’s progress.
